        <h1>The Best Part of Lockdown</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>The website you are currently viewing is about my experience with lockdown, what the best part of lockdown was for me, and what tips I would give people to survive a lockdown in 30 years time. I'll also include a game I had played during the lockdown called Rainbow Six Siege, a shooter game.</p>
        <p>About my experience with lockdown, it wasn't hard at all. This was probably because all I did was play video games and read manhwa (Manhwa is a korean comic book). I also ate and slept a lot. Now on about the best part of lockdown for me which was probably being able to play games all day long thanks to lockdown closing school for the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>Now for tips I would give in case of a lockdown in 30 years. Some tips I would give would be to just stay in your home. If you were invited outside by some friends to play football or something else, say no. If you stay home and don't leave, you won't get sick by whatever disease or illness is outside. In my opinion, not being sick by whatever actually caused a lockdown is much better than having fun with your friend and getting sick in the process.</p>
        <p> Now for Rainbow Six, a game I played during the lockdown. I played a lot of games because just staying inside was boring. A game I'll go into a bit of detail is Rainbow Six Siege, R6 Siege for short. R6 Siege is a game about 2 teams, 'Attackers' and 'Defenders'. The game is about these 2 teams trying to win a round. Some rounds you're an attacker and others you're a defender. First to win 3 rounds, win the match. In my opinion, R6 was a fun game to play during lockdown. The game is a first-person shooter game owned by Ubisoft, a company that creates games.</p>
