			<h1>Covid-19 lockdown</h1>

			<h2>What I did during the pandemic?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>During the pandemic I mainly helped out my parents with chores and other stuff, but when I'm not doing that I'd be playing games a lot of the time.Most of the endemic I was inside playing games because those games kept me sane when there was a terrifying virus outside.The main games that i was playing at that time was Tom Clansy's Rainbow Six Siege,Minecraft and osu.For this webpage I am going to talk about Tom Clansy's Rainbow Six Siege because I loved playing that game during the pandemic. be play Tom clansy's Rainbow six siege and I loved playing that game during the pandemic.</p>

			<h3>What is Tom clansy's Rainbow six siege?</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Tom clansy's Rainbow six Siege or also known as R6 or Rainbow but for simpliscty ill be calling it R6.R6 is an online first person tatical shoots its a 5 V 5 close combat defusing the bomb or Rescue the hostage game.It was developed by unbisoft montreal and was realeased to the public at december 1st 2015 on PC,PS4 and xbox one.</p>
			<p>In R6 you have two sides either the attacker or the defenders.Normaly Defenders would be defending either the bomb or the hostage while the attackers and trying to defuse the bomb or rescue the hostage.Each side have a huge amout of operators in the game as of writing there are total of 64 operators in the game 32 attackers and 32 defender.</p>

			<h3></h3>
			<h4>Best Defender in my opinion</h4>
			<p>Oryx Has the T-5 SMG which is one of the best primary SMG in the game It has a quick fire rate good overall damage and low recoil but the only problem is that it lacks a grip.Then the spaz 12 it's a good shotgun is has fast fire rate quick reload and controllable recoil.He either has the BAILIFF 410 which is a shotgun pistol or the USP40.The bailiff is a shotgun pistol that is really good with his passive which we'll get into a bit.For his gadgets he either has the barbed wires or the proximity alarm sounding every time an attacker is nearby this is personal preference on what you pick</p>
			<br>
			<p>Oryx's ability is  the Remah Dash which allows him to to dash up to 5 meters and he can dash through soft walls destroy on impact.You can also dash into people staggering them.It's really useful because you don't have to deal with shield operators like montagne you can dash into them and they will fall over then you can shoot them then they die.He is really good at dashing through walls and operators but be careful if you dash into a wall it hurts oryx by 5 HP.</p>

			<h4>Best Attacker in my opinion</h4>
			<p>The sledge has the L85A2 low recoil, high damage but bit slow fire rate. then his secondary the SMG 11 one of the best secondary its really useful for close combat situations the only problem is there is a really high recoil spread and but if you can master it is one of the deadly weapons in the game due to the high recoil. sledges secondary gadgets are stuns or frag grenades but i'd always pick frag grenades.</p>
			<p>Sledge's ability is a sledge hammer hense his name sledge. His hammer can break through soft walls almost in an instant and it's big enough for someone to walk in and comboing his gun and gadgets it's one of the most powerful operators oh and did I tell you he can use it 25 times.</p>

			<h3>Tips to survive the pandemic in 30 years time</h3>
			<p>So if there ever was a pandemic in 30 year because you know everyday since 2020 is getting worse so its best to prepare for the work.Tip 1. personally if you have the money get an indoor gym in your house because for a long duration of you saying home and not going out will make you obeast basically fat.</p>
			<p>Tip 2. make sure to develop new hobbies. if you don't develop new hobbies you'd be bored out of your mind and it's better to learn how to cook, draw etc.</p>
			<p>Tip 3 obviously stay indoors.you need to protect yourself and others like family and friends by staying inside and avoid getting the virus because it's really dangerous and harmful for everyone.</p>
